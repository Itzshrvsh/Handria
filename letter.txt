Subject: Request for Leave from 29th July to 31st July 2025

Dear Sir,

I am writing to formally request leave for three days, from 29th July to 31st July 2025, due to a personal commitment that requires my presence out of town.

I have ensured that I will complete all pending assignments beforehand, and I will coordinate with my classmates to stay updated with any coursework during my absence.

I kindly request you to consider my application and grant me leave for the mentioned dates.

Thank you for your understanding.

Yours sincerely,  
Sharvesh S
