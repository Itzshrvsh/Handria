# Handria
Handria (Human-Artistic Neural Drawing Intelligence Assistant) is a deep learning project that generates realistic handwritten characters using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It mimics the human way of writing — from the shaky ‘a’ to the perfectly imperfect ‘Z’. No boring fonts here — just raw, pixel-powered handwriting.
